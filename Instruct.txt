In this game you are a dog or wolf and your job is to herd the sheep into small pens. Moving your character will create a fence in the locations you pass through.

You will complete the level when you have filled 75% of the board in fence without losing all three of your lives.

Do not let the sheep hit you or let it run into an unfinished fence or you will lose a life. There also can be snakes that crawl on the fence that will cause you to lose a life if hit.

Be careful, in higher levels the snakes will also become a little bit smarter.

You will have a choice between four different characters:

Labrador Retriever:
       This character has a 1/3 chance of not losing a life when a sheep hits a fence you are currently making.

German Shepherd:
       This character has a 1/3 chance of evading a sheep if it comes in direct contact with one.

Dachshund:
       The small size of this character allows it a 1/3 chance of evading a snake if it comes in contact with one.

Wolf:
       This character will eat a sheep if it comes in contact with one and moving it to a random spot on the board.


Controls:
    Use the arrow keys to control your character. Pressing 'p' will pause the game.
